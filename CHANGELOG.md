## [0.1.36]

- Added Sentry error reporting to help identify and fix crashes faster
- Fixed terminal sessions sometimes failing to reconnect, which caused the terminal emulator to scroll to the top during card transitions before scrolling back down
- Fixed onboarding to default to Cline as the AI provider and automatically set the provider's default model, preventing errors when switching providers without updating the model
- Fixed Ctrl+C to wait for Cline to finish shutting down before fully exiting, preventing false double-interrupt exits
- Upgraded Cline SDK from 0.0.7 to 0.0.11 with numerous fixes and improvements:
  - Fixed prompt caching being broken for Anthropic models, meaning users were paying full price every turn. Cost calculation was also fixed (it was double-counting cache reads and ignoring cache writes)
  - Fixed cancelling a request causing all subsequent requests in the session to immediately fail, due to a reused AbortController
  - Fixed Gemini tool use failing for most non-trivial tool schemas. JSON Schema properties not in Gemini's allowed set (like `default`, `pattern`, `minLength`) caused Gemini to reject entire requests
  - Fixed tools with no required parameters (like "list all") being silently dropped
  - Fixed CLI hanging indefinitely in CI/Docker environments when stdin was detected as "not a TTY" but wasn't providing input
  - Fixed Vercel AI Gateway being completely broken (base URL was `.app` instead of `.sh`, so all requests 404'd)
  - Fixed internal metadata fields leaking into API requests sent to providers, wasting tokens
  - Fixed multi-agent team tools failing when the orchestrator sent null for optional filter parameters. Also added concurrent run prevention and better error visibility for teammate failures
  - Fixed MCP tool names with special characters or exceeding 128 chars causing provider schema validation errors (now sanitized with a hash suffix)
  - Fixed OpenRouter and other gateway error messages showing opaque nested JSON blobs instead of the actual error
  - Fixed `--json` mode output being impure (plain text warnings leaked into stdout, breaking JSONL parsing)
  - Fixed SQLite crashing with a disk I/O error on first run instead of auto-creating the data directory
  - Fixed "Sonic boom is not ready yet" error on CLI exit
  - Removed hardcoded 8,192 max output tokens per turn cap, so models are no longer artificially limited
  - Added OpenAI-compatible prompt caching support
  - Added OpenAI-compatible providers now surface truncated responses (`finish_reason: "length"`) so callers can detect them
  - Headless mode no longer requires a persisted API key -- env vars like `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` now work
  - Headless mode output cleaned up: model info, welcome line, and summary gated behind `--verbose`
  - Config directory is now overridable via `--config` flag or `CLINE_DIR` env var for isolated config across multiple SDK instances
  - `readFile` executor now supports optional `start_line`/`end_line` parameters, enabling models to read specific portions of large files

## [0.1.35]

- Settings now automatically retry loading when the initial attempt fails, improving reliability on slower connections

## [0.1.34]

- Fixed Kanban agent creating tasks for worktree paths instead of the main project

## [0.1.33]

- Fixed task worktree setup for Turbopack projects no longer attempting slow background copies of node_modules; affected subproject dependencies are now correctly skipped instead of symlinked

## [0.1.32]

- Fix concurrent task mutations (e.g. adding multiple tasks at the same time) failing due to write conflicts -- task mutations now use a workspace lock to safely handle simultaneous operations
- Fix a bug where stopping a task that was restored from a previous session would fail because the session wasn't properly reconnected on startup
- Fix a bug where restarting the app would show raw metadata in user messages for old Cline sessions that were reloaded
- Fix worktrees for projects using Turbopack, where symlinked node_modules would cause build failures -- worktrees now fall back to copying node_modules for Turbopack projects
- Fix SDK command parsing that could cause agent system prompts to be malformed
- Fix Cmd+V image paste in the chat composer not working due to the paste handler running asynchronously, causing the browser to swallow the event
- Fix proper-lockfile crashing due to accidentally passing undefined as the onCompromised handler

## [0.1.27]

- Upgraded Cline SDK to stable v0.0.4, replacing nightly builds for more reliable native Cline sessions

## [0.1.26]

- The agent can now trash and delete tasks on your behalf using new task management commands
- When no CLI agent is detected, a guided setup flow walks you through getting started
- Replaced the Kanban skill system with `--append-system-prompt` -- since the board now has a dedicated agent, we just append context to its prompt instead of maintaining a separate skill

## [0.1.8]

- Terminal now properly renders full-screen TUI applications like OpenCode
- Fixed terminal content disappearing and scroll back being lost when opening a task. Terminals are now created proactively for each agent instead of connecting mid-session, which preserves full scroll back and content rendering. This is especially important for rendering TUI apps like Codex and Droid correctly.
- Improved terminal rendering quality, inspired by VS Code's xterm and node-pty implementation. Noticeably higher FPS, smoother scrolling, and a more native look and feel for terminal emulators.

## [0.1.7]

- When a task prompt mentions creating tasks (e.g. "break down into tasks", "create 3 tickets", "split into cards"), Kanban now shows a setup dialog offering to install the Kanban MCP before the task starts
- Similar setup dialogs appear for Linear and GitHub CLI when task prompts reference those services
- MCP server instructions now guide agents to detect the ephemeral worktree path and pass the main worktree as projectPath, so "add tasks in kanban" tasks correctly create tasks in the main workspace instead of the ephemeral task worktree

## [0.1.4]

- Each task gets its own CLI agent working in a git worktree, so they can work in parallel on the same codebase without stepping on each other
- When an agent finishes, review diffs and leave comments before deciding what to merge
- Commit or open a PR directly from the board, and the agent writes the commit message or PR description for you
- Link tasks together to create dependency chains, where one task finishing kicks off the next, letting you complete large projects end to end
- "Automatically commit" and "automatically open PR" toggles give agents more autonomy to complete work on their own
- MCP integration lets agents add and start tasks on the board themselves, decomposing large work into parallelizable linked tasks
- Built-in git visualizer shows your branches and commit history so you can track the work your agents are doing
