# Development

## Requirements

- Node.js 20+
- npm 10+

## Install

```bash
npm run install:all
```

## Hot reload workflow

Fast path:

```bash
npm run dev:full
```

- Starts the runtime in watch mode and the Vite web UI dev server together
- Auto-picks free runtime and web UI ports so multiple checkouts can run side by side
- Best for day-to-day source development, especially web UI work and runtime changes that benefit from fast iteration

Manual equivalent in two terminals:

1. Runtime server (API + PTY agent runtime):

```bash
npm run dev
```

- Runs on `http://127.0.0.1:3484`

2. Web UI (Vite HMR):

```bash
npm run web:dev
```

- Runs on `http://127.0.0.1:4173`
- `/api/*` requests from Vite are proxied to `http://127.0.0.1:3484`

Use `http://127.0.0.1:4173` while developing UI so changes hot reload.

## Choose the right workflow

Use `npm run dev:full` when you are actively developing Kanban and want fast iteration. It runs the source checkout with `tsx watch` plus the Vite web UI dev server, so runtime changes reload and web UI changes get HMR.

By default, `dev:full` now starts Kanban with `--skip-shutdown-cleanup` so stopping a debug/dev instance does not move cards to Trash or delete task worktrees from your active boards.

To opt back into shutdown cleanup while using `dev:full`, run:

```bash
npm run dev:full -- --with-shutdown-cleanup
```

If `node_modules` has not been installed in this worktree, `dev:full` auto-runs `npm ci` before launch.

Use `npm run dogfood` when you want to validate the latest built CLI behavior more realistically. It builds the current checkout and launches `dist/cli.js`, which is better for checking packaged behavior, startup and shutdown flows, multi-instance dogfooding, and launch behavior against a target project.

## VS Code F5 debugging

The repo includes `.vscode/launch.json` with two configurations:

- `Dev (Full Stack)`: Launches the same workflow as `npm run dev:full`, starting both the runtime and Vite in one terminal.
- `Run Tests`: Runs `vitest run` with the debugger so you can set breakpoints in tests.

Shutdown cleanup flags:

- `--skip-shutdown-cleanup`: do not move sessions to trash or delete task worktrees on shutdown

## Build and run packaged CLI

```bash
npm run build
node dist/cli.js
```

This mode serves built web assets from `dist/web-ui` and does not hot reload the web UI.

Runtime port options:

```bash
# fixed port
node dist/cli.js --port 3484

# pick the first free port starting at 3484
node dist/cli.js --port auto
```

You can still use `KANBAN_RUNTIME_PORT` if needed, but `--port` is preferred for local multi-instance runs.

## Dogfooding with two Kanban instances

Run your stable orchestrator first (main checkout):

```bash
cd /path/to/kanban-main
npm run build
node dist/cli.js --port 3484
```

Then run a test checkout against a target project (feature worktree):

```bash
cd /path/to/kanban-feature-worktree
npm run dogfood -- --project /path/to/target/repo --port auto
```

If `--project` is omitted, the launcher starts Kanban from a non-git cwd so runtime behaves like launching outside a git repo and opens the first indexed project (if any):

```bash
npm run dogfood -- --port auto
```

Dogfood launcher behavior:

- builds the current checkout by default
- launches `dist/cli.js` with `cwd` set to the target project
- supports `--port <number|auto>`
- supports `--no-open`
- supports `--skip-build` when you already built and want faster restarts
- is the right choice when you want to test the latest built CLI rather than the source-mode dev server

## Run `kanban` from any directory

After cloning and installing dependencies, create/update the global CLI link from this repo:

```bash
npm run link
```

Verify:

```bash
which kanban
kanban --version
```

Then run from any project directory:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
kanban
```

After local code changes, run `npm run build` again before using the linked command.

When switching between worktrees, re-run `npm run link` from the worktree you want to test so the global `kanban` binary points at the right `dist/cli.js`. For sidebar agent automation guidance, inspect `src/prompts/append-system-prompt.ts`.

Remove the global link:

```bash
npm run unlink
```

## Scripts

- `npm run build`: build runtime and bundled web UI into `dist`
- `npm run dogfood -- [--project <path>] [--port <number|auto>] [--no-open] [--skip-build]`: build and launch this checkout, optionally targeting a specific project path
- `npm run dev`: run CLI in watch mode
- `npm run dev:full`: run the runtime watch server and Vite web UI dev server together
- `npm run web:dev`: run web UI dev server
- `npm run web:build`: build web UI
- `npm run typecheck`: typecheck runtime
- `npm run web:typecheck`: typecheck web UI
- `npm run test`: run runtime tests
- `npm run web:test`: run web UI tests
- `npm run check`: lint, typecheck, and test runtime package

## Tests

- `test/integration`: integration tests for runtime behavior and startup flows
- `test/runtime`: runtime unit tests
- `test/utilities`: shared test helpers

## Agent tracking and runtime hooks

Kanban tracks agent session state with runtime hook events. The core transition model is:

- `in_progress -> review`
- `review -> in_progress`

Internal runtime session states are named `running` and `awaiting_review`, and hook events are transition intents:

- `to_in_progress` for `review -> in_progress`
- `to_review` for `in_progress -> review`

How it works end to end:

1. `prepareAgentLaunch` wires each agent with hook commands or hook-aware wrappers.
2. Hook handlers call `kanban hooks ...` subcommands.
3. `kanban hooks ingest --event <to_review|to_in_progress>` reads hook context from env:
   - `KANBAN_HOOK_TASK_ID`
   - `KANBAN_HOOK_WORKSPACE_ID`
   - `KANBAN_HOOK_PORT`
4. The ingest command calls runtime TRPC `hooks.ingest`.
5. The runtime applies guarded transitions and ignores duplicates or invalid transitions as no-ops.

Current agent mappings:

These are external agent/file-hook names where the agent config requires them.
They are distinct from Cline SDK plugin runtime hooks such as `beforeRun`,
`beforeTool`, `afterTool`, and `afterRun`.

- Claude
  - `UserPromptSubmit`, `PostToolUse`, `PostToolUseFailure` emit `to_in_progress`
  - `Stop`, `PermissionRequest`, and `Notification` with `permission_prompt` emit `to_review`
- Codex
  - wrapper enables TUI session logging and maps:
    - `task_started` and `exec_command_begin` to `to_in_progress`
    - `*_approval_request` to `to_review`
  - Codex `notify` completion path also emits `to_review`
- Gemini
  - `BeforeAgent` and `AfterTool` emit `to_in_progress`
  - `AfterAgent` emits `to_review`
  - hook command writes `{}` to stdout immediately to satisfy Gemini hook contract, then notifies in background
- OpenCode
  - plugin maps busy activity to `to_in_progress`
  - plugin maps idle/error and permission ask to `to_review`
  - plugin filters child sessions to avoid false transitions from nested runs
- Droid
  - `PreToolUse` for active tools like `Read`, `Grep`, `Glob`, `FetchUrl`, `WebSearch`, `Execute`, `Task`, `Edit`, and `Create` emits `to_in_progress`
  - `PreToolUse` for `AskUser` and `Stop` emit `to_review`
  - `PostToolUse` for `AskUser` and `UserPromptSubmit` emit `to_in_progress`

Important behavior details:

- Hooks are best-effort and should not crash or block the underlying agent process.
- Hook notify paths are asynchronous to keep agent UX responsive.
- Runtime transition guards are authoritative and prevent state flapping from duplicate events.
- Hook transport is implemented in Node and invoked through `kanban hooks ...`, so the behavior is consistent across Windows and non-Windows environments.

## PostHog telemetry config

The web UI reads PostHog settings at build time:

- `POSTHOG_KEY`
- `POSTHOG_HOST`

Local development:
- Set these in `web-ui/.env.local` (see `web-ui/.env.example`).
- If `POSTHOG_KEY` is missing, telemetry does not initialize.

Release builds:
- The publish workflow injects `POSTHOG_KEY` and `POSTHOG_HOST` from GitHub Secrets.
- `POSTHOG_HOST` is optional and defaults to `https://data.cline.bot`.

Result:
- Official releases have telemetry enabled.
- Forks and source builds have telemetry disabled unless a key is explicitly provided.
